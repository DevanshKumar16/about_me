Hello! I'm Devansh Kumar, a BTech student majoring in Information Technology at VIT Vellore. I have a keen interest in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Visualization. During my academic journey, I had the wonderful opportunity to intern under Dr. Dipanjan Goswami professor at IIT Delhi, where I got hands-on experience working on cutting-edge AI/ML projects. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me the passion to delve deeper into this field. I am always eager to take on challenging problems and apply my knowledge to come up with innovative solutions.
